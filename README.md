## 🗂️ JSL Kanban Task Management App

A client-side task management web application designed to help organize tasks into TODO, DOING, and DONE columns—mimicking a Kanban board. Users can create, edit, delete, and categorize tasks with persistent storage using localStorage.

## ✨ Key Features

🆕 Create, Edit & Delete Tasks: Manage tasks quickly through a reusable modal interface.

📋 Task Status Columns: Visualize tasks in TODO, DOING, and DONE columns.

💾 Persistent Storage: All tasks are saved in localStorage to maintain data between sessions.

🔢 Dynamic Task Counts: Column headers automatically update with the current number of tasks.

🎨 Theme Toggle: Switch between light and dark modes for a personalized workspace.

📂 Sidebar Toggle: Collapse or expand the sidebar for a cleaner interface.

⏳ Loading Indicator: Shows a loading message while tasks are fetched asynchronously.

## 🌐 Live Demo

## 💻 Installation & Running Locally

Prerequisites

Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)

Optional: Local HTTP server for proper ES module support

Steps

Clone or download the repository:

git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-folder>

Using a local server (recommended):

npm install -g live-server # install live-server globally
live-server # start the server in project folder

The app will open in your browser with full ES module support.

Note: Directly opening index.html may cause issues due to ES module restrictions in some browsers.

## ⚙️ How It Works

On load, tasks are fetched asynchronously from localStorage or fallback default tasks.

Tasks are rendered dynamically into columns based on their status (todo, doing, done).

Clicking a task opens a modal for editing or deleting it.

The "Add New Task" button opens a modal to create new tasks.

All changes are saved to localStorage and reflected immediately on the board.

Users can toggle themes and sidebar visibility to customize their workspace.
